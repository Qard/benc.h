# benc.h

benc.h is a single-header benchmarking framework for C or C++. It avoids taking
over the process, leaving it to the user to handle the setup, which enables
running in weird environments like inside a Node.js native module.

See [example.c](example.c) and [example.cc](example.cc) for how to use it.
